I am a 5th year PhD candidate at South China University of Technology. My advisor is Prof. Qiong Liu. Before that, I obtained my B.E. degree at South China University of Technology in 2015.

I am interested in computer vision, deep learning, and machine learning. More specifically,

* Object Detection
* Auto Machine Learning
* Crowd Counting

Now, I am visiting [Vision and Learning Lab](http://vllab.ucmerced.edu/) at University of California, Merced, under the supervision of Prof. [Ming-Hsuan Yang](https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mhyang/).
